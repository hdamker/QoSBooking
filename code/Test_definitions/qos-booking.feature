Feature: CAMARA QoS Booking API, v0.1.0-rc.1 - API Operations
    # Input to be provided by the implementation to the tester
    #
    # Implementation indications:
    # * apiRoot: API root of the server URL
    # * List of device identifier types which are not supported, among: phoneNumber, ipv4Address, ipv6Address.
    #   For this version, CAMARA does not allow the use of networkAccessIdentifier, so it is considered by default as not supported.
    # * List of application server IP formats which are not supported, among ipv4 and ipv6.
    #
    # Testing assets:
    # * A device object applicable for QoS Booking service.
    # * A device object identifying a device commercialized by the implementation for which the service is not applicable, if any.
    # * The bookingId of an existing QoS Booking, and the request properties used for createBooking
    # * The BookingInfo of an existing QoS Booking
    # * A device object with an existing QoS Booking associated, and the request properties used for createBooking
    # * A device object with NO existing QoS Booking associated
    #
    # References to OAS spec schemas refer to schemas specified in qos-booking.yaml
